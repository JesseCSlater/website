A prerequisite to SQL compiler verification is a formal semantic foundation for SQL. Formalizations of SQL have traditionally relied on unordered semantics for tables based on sets or multi-sets, but SQL contains important operations such as LIMIT and ORDER BY which cannot be formalized with unordered table semantics. We present Fluorite, a simple calculus which serves as a semantic foundation for SQL queries with ordering. Fluorite uses a nondeterministic semantics over lists to support both ordered and unordered operations. It includes an equational theory which can be used to prove interesting query equivalences. We implement Fluorite's semantics and verify its equational theory in the Lean proof assistant.
